As part of The Odin Project, I'll be remaking a simple, classic Google homepage as part of Web Development 101 (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

I'm going to update this to the more modern Google homepage next.

3/2/18 - updated it to look more like a modern Google homepage, though not functional.
